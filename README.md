Analysis of gender pay gaps, life expectancy, and population distribution in six European countries (2020–2022).
# Gender Perspectives in Europe: Pay Gaps, Life Expectancy & Population (2020–2022)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **demographic and socioeconomic indicators** across six European countries — **France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, and Lithuania** — between **2020 and 2022**.  
The focus is on:
- **Life expectancy** (male vs. female)  
- **Gender pay gap**  
- **Population distribution by gender**  

By using **Eurostat** and **OECD datasets**, the project provides insights into how gender disparities manifest in different European contexts, particularly during and after the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Life Expectancy:**  
  - Women consistently outlive men across all countries.  
  - France and Italy show the highest averages (84–85 years for women, ~80 years for men).  
  - Latvia and Lithuania exhibit shorter life expectancies (males: 69–71 years, females: ~79–80 years).  

- **Population Distribution:**  
  - Women make up a slightly higher proportion of the population (≈51.5%).  
  - France and Italy have the largest populations among the selected nations.  

- **Gender Pay Gap:**  
  - Italy and Croatia: lower discrepancies (4–7%).  
  - Latvia: highest gap (~22% in 2020, reduced to 17% by 2022).  

- **Correlation Insight:**  
  - Countries with **smaller pay gaps** (Italy, France) often exhibit **higher life expectancies**, suggesting a potential link between **socioeconomic equality** and **public health outcomes**.

## 📑 Conclusion
The analysis highlights the **intersection of gender, health, and socioeconomic equality** in Europe.  
- Western countries (France, Italy) show stronger public health outcomes and smaller wage gaps.  
- Eastern countries (Latvia, Lithuania) face greater disparities in both health and income equality.  

These insights suggest that **reducing income inequality** and **strengthening health systems** can improve both **public health** and **social cohesion**.
